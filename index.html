        <h1>Hi 👋, I&#39;m <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                href="https://twitter.com/bnguyensn">Binh</a> and this is my GitHub
            Pages page.</h1>

        <p>
            This is a basic HTML page. It doesn&#39;t do anything special but display
            text information.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this page is a reminder for myself of the internet&#39;s core
            value: a bunch of information linked together.
        </p>

        <p>
            A simple concept, yet incredibly powerful. The internet had a similar impact
            to the invention of writing in the sense that it "levelled up"
            humanity&#39;s learning rate. Information went from being unrecorded, to
            being recorded and passed down through generations, to being readily
            available and accessible to almost everyone. There was an exponential
            expansion of knowledge, and boy did humanity seize on that opportunity.
        </p>

        <p>
            What will the next big jump be? How can learning rate be advanced even
            further? We can certainly consider the possibility of directly "beaming" information
            to a person&#39;s brain, cutting out all the current boring typings and searching
            processes. May there will be an AI that automatically reads our thoughts and instantly
            provides answers after querying its central knowledge net?
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever the future will be, I am excited for it.
        </p>
